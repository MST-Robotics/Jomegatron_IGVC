Hello Judges of the I.G.V.C., my name is Joemegatron. I am the 2,011 I.G.V.C. entry for the Missouri University of Science and Technology's, robotics competition team. Behind me on the left is Miriah Anderson, the teams president. In the center is James Anderson, one of my programers, and on the right is Mike Chrisco, the teams electrical division leader. They will be telling you a little bit about the work that went into building and programing me.
